## The Time-varying Dynamic Network Model for Extracting the Dyanmic Resting State Functional Connectivity


This is repo is to implement a time-varying dynamic network (TVDN) method to 
extract the resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) from both 
functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) and the magnetoencephalography (MEG) imaging.
