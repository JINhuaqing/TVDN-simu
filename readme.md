# The Time-varying Dynamic Network Model for Extracting the Dyanmic Resting State Functional Connectivity


This is repo is to implement a time-varying dynamic network (TVDN) method to 
extract the resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) from both 
functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) and the magnetoencephalography (MEG) imaging.


## Installation

- Enviroment:
  - Python 3
  - R
 
```
git clone https://github.com/JINhuaqing/TVDN.git
```
For dependencies in Python, run

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`signal` pakcage in R is also needed

```R

install.packages("signal")
```
