# The Time-varying Dynamic Network Model for Extracting the Dyanmic Resting State Functional Connectivity


This is repo is to implement a time-varying dynamic network (TVDN) method to 
extract the resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) from both 
functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) and the magnetoencephalography (MEG) imaging.

It contains the simulation code, so we change the name to `TVDN-simu`. 

**We provide a more clearer version of the code, plz refer to `TVDN` repository.**
